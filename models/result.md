This scenario describes a potential violation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

Specifically, this could be a violation of:

*   **Article 11** of CEDAW, which addresses discrimination in employment. Article 11(1) calls on States Parties to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, the same rights, in particular: (a) The right to work; (b) The right to the same employment opportunities, including the application of the same criteria for selection in matters of employment.

**Steps the woman can take:**

1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect any performance reviews, emails, or documents that demonstrate her high performance and qualifications. Also, gather any evidence suggesting the male colleague was less qualified or experienced.
2.  **Internal Grievance Procedure:** If her workplace has an internal grievance procedure, she should file a formal complaint, detailing the discrimination.
3.  **National Human Rights Institutions:** She can file a complaint with the relevant national human rights commission or ombudsman's office in her country. These institutions are often mandated to investigate discrimination cases.
4.  **Legal Action:** Consult with an attorney to explore legal options. Depending on the jurisdiction, she may be able to file a lawsuit for gender discrimination.
5.  **Report to CEDAW Committee:** If national remedies are exhausted or ineffective, she may be able to submit a communication to the CEDAW Committee, if her country is a party to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW.
